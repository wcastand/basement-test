This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The animation comes from [Codrops](https://github.com/akella/webGLImageTransitions).

I made some changes to do what i wanted.
If i had more knowledge of webgl and shaders/animation, i would make the animation return to black from the right (reverse).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
